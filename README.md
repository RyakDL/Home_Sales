Module 22 - Big Data

Overall Comment: 
1) I enjoyed working in Google colab and I think this was a nice introduction to Big Data analytics. I also see the need to really learn SQL beyond my current skillset as it is used for so many different types of datasets. Thank you for a terrific bootcamp and I'm looking forward to finishing the class strong with Project 4.
